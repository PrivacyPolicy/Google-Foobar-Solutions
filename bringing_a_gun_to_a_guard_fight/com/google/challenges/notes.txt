Polling one at a time just isn't possible. So, think of it in terms of reflection amounts.
Zero bounces can be shot one way
One bounce can be shot two ways
Two bounces can be shot 4 ways
Three bounces can be shot... I'm willing to venture 8 ways?



Where is (0, 0): Top-left or bottom-left? It ultimately doen't matter,
but I'm doing bottom-left.




shot [-1, -1] causes an error, which may be a rounding one...
